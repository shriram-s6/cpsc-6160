## Assignment One: Game Design of Space Invaders

Contributors: Shriram Sekar

This repository contains my submission for Assignment One of CPSC 6160 2D Game Design. In this assignment, I designed a 2D game based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders.

## Introduction

Space Invaders is a classic arcade video game that was released in 1978. It was designed by Tomohiro Nishikado and was one of the first shooting games ever created. In this game, the player controls a laser cannon and must shoot down waves of alien invaders that are descending towards the bottom of the screen. The game became very popular due to its addictive gameplay and simple yet effective design. It has since become a pop culture icon and has been referenced in numerous movies, TV shows, and other forms of media.

## Installation

Python version: 3.11.0

Pygame version: 2.2.0

Run the following command to install the required packages.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Instructions for running the game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your terminal/command prompt
3. Run `python main.py` from the space_invaders folder to start the game

## Game controls

* Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player's spaceship
* Press the space bar to shoot lasers at the invading aliens
* If the player's spaceship collides with an alien or an alien reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over

## Future enhancements

In the future, I plan to add the following features to the game:

* Power-ups for the player's spaceship
* Different types of aliens with unique abilities
* Boss battles at the end of each level
